# Soon you'll know...

- __What it is.__  
  - List data assets which make up the `r bsicons::bs_icon("stack")` `trilogy`

- __How to use it.__ 
  - Use tales and taxonomies with data science tools
  - Create a pipeline for novel, reproducible research
  - Contribute fixes, extensions or annotated texts.

# What is it?

- Tidy data of folklore taxonomies and annotated texts
- A common platform for reproducible research
- Open for use with a [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license
- Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/j-hagedorn/trilogy)

## `r bsicons::bs_icon("border-style")` Contents

- `tmi`: the *Thompson Motif Index*

- `aft`: some *Annotated Folktales*, seeded with [D.L. Ashlimanâ€™s corpus](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html)

## How `r bsicons::bs_icon("stack")`'s parts relate

![Relation of Trilogy elements](TMI_ATU_AFT.png)

# What isn't it?

## `r bsicons::bs_icon("exclamation-triangle-fill")` Some limitations

- These taxonomies were designed for paper, and still need some adjustment
- Motifs are not a periodic table of elements
- Lacks oral elements of tale-telling (*e.g. dramatic pauses*)

# How can you use it?

## `r bsicons::bs_icon("vector-pen")` Research

- Promote [reproducible research](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-012420-105110) of folklore narrative
- Less data cleaning, more analysis
- [Let even distant teams collaborate](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git)
- Extensible base of knowledge *via* user contributions

## `r bsicons::bs_icon("noise-reduction")` Cleaning

- Data quality improves as data is used
- [File issues](https://github.com/j-hagedorn/trilogy/issues/new) if you find errors or have suggestions
- *Even better*, submit corrections as pull requests `r bsicons::bs_icon("sign-merge-left-fill")`

## `r bsicons::bs_icon("database-fill-add")` Extending

- [Annotating tales](https://github.com/j-hagedorn/trilogy/blob/master/docs/vignettes/getting_started.md#growing-and-refining-the-corpus) and adding to the corpus
- *Do you have students who are annotating tale texts as part of their classes?* Consider collecting and uploading correct annotations to grow this repository
