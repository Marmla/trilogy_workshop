This repository is a companion for the workshop conducted at the [19th Congress of the International Society for Folk Narrative Research](https://en.lfk.lv/isfnr2024) related to the topic *Digital Approaches in Narrative Research: Opportunities and Challenges*. The workshop is intended for a beginner audience of folklorists who are interested in learning about the use of data science tools to analyze folktale texts, types, and motifs using the `trilogy` ensemble of datasets.  For this workshop, we will be using the `R` statistical programming language, as well as `Git` to share code. Please read the following instructions in preparation for your attendance at the workshop.
